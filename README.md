# Short URL SPA/Laravel FRONTEND

This project is built with the React library to create SPA in order to consume an API made with Laravel.

The application implements a record and implementation of shortened urls in order to be able to manage these urls in order to share them with their friends and to be able to keep them.

## DEMO 

I share a link so you can visualize the project before its installation

## Install Project

You need to install all the dependencies of the project for its correct operation

### `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


## Approach of the SPA with React

The method with which I have used React is dividing the tasks of the components to perform tasks. The components that have process logic are called 'container' based on the intelligent components. While the dumb components are in charge of just showing the interfaces and displaying data.
